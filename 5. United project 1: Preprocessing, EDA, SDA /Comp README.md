# Computer games store
## Project Description

You work in the online store "Streamchik", which sells computer games all over the world. Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. You need to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
Here is the data up to 2016. Let's imagine that it's December 2016, and you're planning a campaign for 2017. We need to work out the principle of working with data. It doesn't matter whether you forecast sales for 2017 according to 2016 data or 2027 according to 2026 data.
The data set contains the abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), an association that determines the age rating of computer games. ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it a suitable age category, for example, "For adults", "For younger children" or "For teenagers".
