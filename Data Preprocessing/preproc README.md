# Investigation of the reliability of borrowers

## Project Description

The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to understand whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank — statistics on the solvency of customers.
The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model — a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.
