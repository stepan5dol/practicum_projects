# Tariff analysis

## Project Description

You are an analyst at "Megaline", a federal mobile operator. Customers are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money.
You will have to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. You have the data of 500 Megalyne users at your disposal: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and conclude which tariff is better.
