# Research of ads for the sale of apartments

## Project Description

At your disposal are the data of the Yandex Real Estate service — an archive of ads for several years about the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements.

Your task is to perform data preprocessing and study them to find interesting features and dependencies that exist in the real estate market.
The database contains two types of data about each apartment: user-added and cartographic. For example, the first type includes the area of the apartment, its floor and the number of balconies, the second — the distance to the city center, the airport and the nearest park.
