# Studying projects form "Data Science" course at Yandex.Practicum

Each project in numerical order reflects the `stages of studying` aspects of the Data Scientist profession.

Most of projects were based on `real data`.

All projects were aimed to train specific skill. `United projects` were needed to train all previously studied material.
